# Railway-Application
This is the desktop based railway application with similar functionality like NTES.
For directly running this application in your system, you should have java pre installed in your system.
Or if you are having java already in your system then do the following steps:

1. Copy the dist folder in your system (copy whole folder)
2. Double click on the jar file placed there, do not try to change the location of jar because the is dependent on the location of lib 
   folder which is inside the dist.
3. Now you are all set to use the desktop based TES(Train Enquiry System).
